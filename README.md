# ✈️ Airline Management System

A **web system for flight ticket sales and management**, developed as part of the *Data Structures II* course.  
This project simulates the internal and external operations of an airline company using **Python, Flask**, and fundamental **data structures**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The system provides two main modules:

### 👤 Passenger Module
- Search for available flights by destination.
- View possible connections between flights.
- Select and purchase tickets.
- Generate a unique reservation code.
- Accumulate miles with each purchase.

### 🧑‍💼 Administrative Module
- User authentication using a dictionary (login/password).
- Manage flight data (add, edit, remove).
- Track seat availability and reservations.
- Store purchases and clients in local files.
- Use of **B-Trees** and **Graphs** (implemented in future parts).

---

## 🧩 Project Objectives
- Apply **data structures** in a real-world software context.  
- Develop a **Flask-based web system** using dictionaries, JSON files, and later B-Trees and Graphs.  
- Deliver a modular, maintainable, and user-friendly platform.  
- Implement an innovative feature (to be defined in the final stage).
